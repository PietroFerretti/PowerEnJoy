\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Revision History}

\subsection{Purpose and Scope}

\paragraph{}
The purpose of this document is to provide a complete description of the integration testing plans for PowerEnjoy. It will focus on testing the proper behavior of the software by checking the 
interoperability between its components.
It is intended for developers and for any team member involved in the testing process.
%TODO inserire outline dei contenuti?

\paragraph{}
The aim of this project is to specify in detail a new digital management software for PowerEnJoy, a car-sharing service that employs electric cars only.

\paragraph{}
PowerEnjoy will offer a very valuable service to its users, letting them borrow cars to drive around the city freely, as an alternative to their own vehicles and public transport.
Among the advantages of using PowerEnJoy we can note being able to find available cars in any place that is served by our system and having dedicated spots to park in (namely, PowerEnJoy's power grid stations).
Furthermore, thanks to the fact that all the cars that we provide are electrically powered, PowerEnJoy is also very environmentally friendly.

%\paragraph{}
%PowerEnJoy's users, after registering, will be able to reserve, unlock and drive the cars our system will provide. Users will be charged per minute until they park the car in a safe area and end the ride.
%Users will be able to park their car temporarily and use it again later, or end their ride remotely.
%
%Our system will incentivize virtuous behaviour by offering several discounts if certain conditions are met (like charging a car at a power grid station).

\subsection{List of Definitions and Abbreviations}

\subsubsection{Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textit{Guest}: a person that is not registered to the system.}
\item{\textit{User}: a person that is registered to the system. Users can log in to the system with their email or username and their password. Their first name, last name, date of birth, driving license ID are stored in the database.}
\item{\textit{Safe area}: a location where the user can park and leave the car. Users can end their ride and park temporarily only in these locations. The set of safe areas is predefined by the system.}
\item{\textit{Power grid station}: a place where cars can be parked and plugged in. While a car is plugged in a power grid station its battery will be recharged. Power grid stations are by definition safe areas.}
\item{\textit{Available car}: a car that is currently not being used by any user, and has not been reserved either. Available cars are in good conditions (not dirty nor damaged) and don’t have dead batteries.}
\item{\textit{Reservation}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{the operation of making a car reserved for a user, i.e. giving permission to unlock and use the car only for that user, forbidding reservations by other users.}
		\item{the time period between the moment a reservation is requested and the moment the user unlocks the car, or the reservation is canceled.}
	\end{itemize}
}
\item{\textit{Ride}: the time period from the moment a reserved car is unlocked to the moment the user notifies that he wants to stop using the car and closes all the doors. A ride doesn’t stop when a car is temporarily parked, but continues until the user chooses to leave the car definitely.}
%\item{\textit{Possession}: users that have reserved and unlocked a car are said to have possession of the car. While a user has possession of a car they are the only person that can drive it, lock or unlock it, and no other person can take possession of it until the user frees it. Users lose possession of a car when their ride ends.}
\item{\textit{Temporary parking}: the act of parking a car in a safe area and, after notifying the system, locking it and leaving it for a finite amount of time. The user that does this retains the right to use the car and can unlock it later to use it again.}
\item{\textit{Bill}: a record of the money owed by the user at the end of a ride.}
\item{\textit{Outstanding bill}: a bill that hasn’t been paid yet. }
\item{\textit{Suspended user}: a user that cannot reserve or use cars. Usually users are suspended because they have outstanding bills.}
\item{\textit{Payment method}: a way to transfer money from the user to the system. Our system will only accept credit cards and online accounts like Paypal.}
\item{\textit{Payment API}: an interface to carry out money transactions, offered by the external provider associated to the payment method used (e.g. a bank).}
%\item{\textit{CAN bus}: a vehicle bus standard designed to allow micro controllers and devices to communicate with each other.}

\section{Integration Strategy}

\subsection{Entry Criteria}

Before starting the integration testing phase specific conditions concerning the whole project development must be met.
First of all, it is fundamental that the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document and the Design Document have been properly written and completed.

%TODO aggiungere percentuali completamento?
Regarding the code development it is only needed that the \textbf{INSERIRE PERCENTUALI} has been written. Furthermore, each component has to be successfully unit tested before being involved in the integration testing.

%  ---ESEMPIO--- This is a required step in order to have a complete picture of the interactions between the diﬀerent components of the system and of the functionalities they oﬀer. Secondly, the integration process should start only when the estimated percentage of completion of every component with respect to its functionalities is: • 100% for the Data Access Utilities component • At least 90% for the Taxi Management System subsystem • At least 70% for the System Administration and Account Management subsystems • At least 50% for the client applications It should be noted that these percentages refer to the status of the project at the beginning of the integration testing phase and they do not represent the minimum completion percentage necessary to consider a component for integration, which must be at least 90%. The choice of having diﬀerent completion percentages for the diﬀerent components has been made to reﬂect their order of integration and to take into account the required time to fully perform integration testing.


\subsection{Elements to be Integrated}

As stated in the Design Document (paragraph 2.2), the system is based on the cooperation of two parts, the \emph{Application Subsystem}  and the \emph{Resource Management Subsystem}. The first handles all the operations related to the user applications and interfaces, while the second takes care of keeping track of all the automatic updates from the sensors in the cars and the charging stations.
The testing process will verify the correctness of the integration between these macro-components after checking the proper cooperation of smaller components inside each subsystem.
Furthermore, it will be tested the higher integration, client/server level, between
\begin{itemize}
\item the Web Application and the Application Subsystem
\item the Car Application and the Application Subsystem
\end{itemize}
Concerning the external APIs, we expect them to work properly so we will only check, by unit testing, that the components execute correctly the API call.


\paragraph{Application Subsystem}
Components to be tested:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Registration
\item Account Manager
\item Car Search
\item PGS Search
\item Safe Areas Search
\item Payment
\item Reservation Manager
\item Unlocking
\item Parking Ride Manager
\item Ride Manager
\item Report Manager
\item Request Dispatcher
\item Model
\end{enumerate}

It will be tested that the Request Dispatcher interacts with each component from 1 to 10 in the proper way and that these components cooperate as expected with the Model one. In addition, it will be tested the integration between the Model component and the DBMS.

\paragraph{Resource Management Subsystem}
Components to be tested:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Car Manager
\item PGS Manager
\item Car Handler
\end{enumerate}

It will be tested the cooperation between the Car Manager and the Car Handler components and between the PGS Manager and the DBMS.



\subsection{Integration Testing Strategy}

\subsection{Sequence of Component / Function Integration}

In this section we will describe in which order the components of our system will be coupled together to be tested and integrated.
First we will integrate the components in each subsystem separately, then the two subsystems (the Application Subsystem and the Resource Management Subsystem) will be combined together.

We will use diagrams to make the dependencies between components clearer. Arrows from a component to another imply that the first component is necessary for the second one to work correctly.


\subsubsection{Software Integration Sequence}

Following our choice of using a bottom-up approach, integration testing will start from two base components: the DBMS and the Car Internal System.
The DBMS is free from dependencies and can be easily used as a starting point.
The Car Internal System on the other hand, even if it is a prerequisite for many of the system's functions to work, requires an interface to the Resource Management Subsystem that we haven't integration tested yet. Fortunately the interface is used only for sending updates about its status, so the interface functions can be easily replaced by an appropriate stub.


\paragraph{Model}
The first two elements to be integrated will be the Model and the DBMS.
The Model is the foundation of the Application Subsystem and integrating it will let us test all the other components in the subsystem.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq1.png}
	}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Power Grid Stations Manager}
On the Resource Management Subsystem we can start from integrating the Power Grid Stations Manager with the DBMS. 
The PGS Manager is almost fully independent from the other components and can be tested easily.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq2.png}
	}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Car Handler}

The Car Handler is the component that is in charge of issuing commands to the car. We can start testing its behavior as soon as the Car Internal System is fully unit tested. We will make use of a stub to simulate the Resource Subsystem Interface.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq3b.png}
	}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Car Manager}
After the Car Handler is integrated we can finally incorporate the Car Manager, the component doing the heavy lifting in the Resource Management Subsystem.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq4.png}
	}
\end{figure}

Once the Car Manager has been integration tested, we can actually test the interaction between the Car Internal System and the Resource Subsystem Interface.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq-ciclo-a.png}
	}
\end{figure}

At this point the Resource Management Subsystem is fully integrated.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq-resource-subs.png}
	}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Application and Resource Subsystems Integration}
We can now proceed to integrating the Application Subsystem and the Resource Subsystem, again following the bottom-up approach.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq-subsystemv1.png}
	}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Application Subsystem Components}
Most of the components in the Application Subsystem are independent from each other, therefore they can be freely tested in parallel.

The Registration Component, the Account Manager, the Car Search Component, the PGS Search Component, the Safe Areas Search Component and the Payment Component only need the Model, while the Reservation Manager, the Unlocking Component, the Parking Component, the Ride Manager and the Report Manager also need to interface with the Resource Subsystem. 



\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq-model1.png}
	}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq-model2b.png}
	}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Request Dispatcher}
The Request Dispatcher acts as a wrapper for all of the requests to the application API, processing and distributing them to the corresponding components. 

This allows us to integrate it with thread based testing: when testing for one of the intermediate components has been finished, we can test the corresponding functionality on the Request Dispatcher, that will interact with the specific component.
The request dispatcher will be integrated one by one with all the other components, until the Application Subsystem is complete.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq-dispatcher.png}
	}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Client Applications Integration Sequence}
Finally, after the whole central system is tested and has been successfully integrated, we will test the interaction between the client applications and the system.

	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq-clients.png}
