\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed analysis of the PowerEnjoy software development project in terms of required cost and time. It highlights the estimation of 
\begin{itemize}
\item project size, calculated using the \emph{Function Points approach} by IBM;
\item project cost and effort, calculated using the \emph{COCOMO II} by Boehm.
\end{itemize}
Given the previous information we elaborate a feasible schedule considering all the necessary activities in detail, thus the best resources' allocation on each one. The last section of the document focuses on handling all the possible risks that could be met during the whole process, from the requirements analysis to the final testing and deployment.


\subsection{Scope}
The aim of this project is to specify and design a new digital management software for PowerEnJoy, a car-sharing service that employs electric cars only.

\paragraph{}
PowerEnJoy will offer a very valuable service to its users, letting them borrow cars to drive around the city freely, as an alternative to their own vehicles and public transport.
Among the advantages of using PowerEnJoy we can note being able to find available cars in any place that is served by our system and having dedicated spots to park in (namely, PowerEnJoy's power grid stations).
Furthermore, thanks to the fact that all the cars that we provide are electrically powered, PowerEnJoy is also very environmentally friendly.

%\paragraph{}
%PowerEnJoy's users, after registering, will be able to reserve, unlock and drive the cars our system will provide. Users will be charged per minute until they park the car in a safe area and end the ride.
%Users will be able to park their car temporarily and use it again later, or end their ride remotely.
%
%Our system will incentivize virtuous behaviour by offering several discounts if certain conditions are met (like charging a car at a power grid station).

\subsection{List of Definitions and Abbreviations}

\subsubsection{Definitions}

%\begin{itemize}
%%\item{\textit{Guest}: a person that is not registered to the system.}
%\item{\textit{User}: a person that is registered to the system. Users can log in to the system with their email or username and their password. Their first name, last name, date of birth, driving license ID are stored in the database.}
%\item{\textit{Safe area}: a location where the user can park and leave the car. Users can end their ride and park temporarily only in these locations. The set of safe areas is predefined by the system.}
%\item{\textit{Power grid station} or \textit{Charging station}: a place where cars can be parked and plugged in. While a car is plugged in a power grid station its battery will be recharged. Power grid stations are by definition safe areas.}
%\item{\textit{Available car}: a car that is currently not being used by any user, and has not been reserved either. Available cars are in good conditions (not dirty nor damaged) and don't have dead batteries.}
%\item{\textit{Reservation}:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item{the operation of making a car reserved for a user, i.e. giving permission to unlock and use the car only for that user, forbidding reservations by other users.}
%		\item{the time period between the moment a reservation is requested and the moment the user unlocks the car, or the reservation is canceled.}
%	\end{itemize}
%}
%\item{\textit{Ride}: the time period from the moment a reserved car is unlocked to the moment the user notifies that he wants to stop using the car and closes all the doors. A ride doesn't stop when a car is temporarily parked, but continues until the user chooses to leave the car definitely.}
%%\item{\textit{Possession}: users that have reserved and unlocked a car are said to have possession of the car. While a user has possession of a car they are the only person that can drive it, lock or unlock it, and no other person can take possession of it until the user frees it. Users lose possession of a car when their ride ends.}
%\item{\textit{Temporary parking}: the act of parking a car in a safe area and, after notifying the system, locking it and leaving it for a finite amount of time. The user that does this retains the right to use the car and can unlock it later to use it again.}
%\item{\textit{Bill}: a record of the money owed by the user at the end of a ride.}
%%\item{\textit{Outstanding bill}: a bill that hasn't been paid yet. }
%\item{\textit{Suspended user}: a user that cannot reserve or use cars. Usually users are suspended because they have outstanding bills that have not been paid.}
%\item{\textit{Payment method}: a way to transfer money from the user to the system. Our system will only accept credit cards and online accounts like Paypal.}
%\item{\textit{Payment API}: an interface to carry out money transactions, offered by the external provider associated to the payment method used (e.g. a bank).}
%\item{\textit{CAN bus}: a vehicle bus standard designed to allow micro controllers and devices to communicate with each other.}

\subsection{Size estimation: function points}
Function points are useful in expressing the amount of business functionality our software has to provide to a user and are used to compute an estimation of its size.
After been identified and categorized into one of five types: outputs, inquiries, inputs, internal files, and external interfaces, each functional requirement is then assessed for complexity and assigned a number of function points.\\
We based our computation on tables and values in \emph{COCOMO II Model Definition Manual v. 2.1}.

\subsubsection{Internal Logic Files (ILFs)}
Internal Logical Files homogeneous set of data used and managed by the application 



quali internal logic files abbiamo?
quali entità di dati abbiamo?

- users
nome, cognome, username, password, dob, email, patente, carta di credito, cvv, stato (sospeso, non sospeso)
- bills
username, importo, data, id ride, car, stato (pagata/non pagata)
- cars
modello, targa, id, available, issues
- reports
id macchina, descrizione, utente, data
- safe areas
latitudine, longitudine, id
- power grid stations
latitudine, longitudine, id
- plugs
id plug, availability
- reservations
user, macchina, data, stato (attiva, annullata, completata)
- rides
user, macchina, data, durata, stato, bill

- mappe per navigatore in locale
in modo complicato
(average)

(- autenticazione
id cosa, credenziali es. chiavi private)

users -> Low
tutti low
7x9+10=73 FPs per ILF

\subsubsection{External Logic Files (ELFs)}

The situations in which our system demands external data is when it needs informations regarding geolocation or when it must guarantee the legal soundness of the Driving License.\\
In particularly:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{GraphHopper API}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Given the string containing the address, the API returns a pair of float representing the coordinates of that location.}
			\item{Given two pair of coordinates, the API return a float representing the time within two position.}
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Eucaris API}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Given name, surname, driving license ID and expiration date as string, the API returns a boolean value representing the correspondence with an existing driving license in Eucaris DB.}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In the final analysis, as the involved data are string and number with restrained size, we can assess this logic files as low complexity.\\

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ | p{6cm} | p{6cm} | p{6cm} }
		\hline
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textit{ELF}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textit{Complexity}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textit{FPs}} \\
		\hline
		Reverse geocoding & Low & 5 \\
		\hline
		Isochrone distance & Low & 5\\
		\hline
		Driving Licenes legal soudness & Low & 5\\
		\hline
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textit{Total} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{15}
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{External Inputs (EIs)}

PowerEnjoy offers a remarkable series of functionalities that required user's input.\\
In particularly:

\begin{itemize}
	\itemize{\textbf{Login}: this functionality demands only two strings as parameters, the username and the password, that will be compared with the ones stored in the DB. We can consider as a low complexity operation.}
	
	\itemize{\textbf{User update}: this functionality includes a collection of operations that allow to modify each aspect of user's profile. The input data are simple strings. Since the possibility are conspicuous and the different elaborations aren't basic and futhermore they interest several components, we can regard this functionality as an avarage complexity operation.}
	
	\itemize{\textbf{Pay bill} (automatically/manually): this is one of the most complex operations. It involves internal components and external APIs and it demands two numbers as input. Given the relevance of the operation and the parts interested, we can consider this as hig complexity operation.}

	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ | p{6cm} | p{6cm} | p{6cm} }
		\hline
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textit{EI}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textit{Complexity}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textit{FPs}} \\
		\hline
		Login & Low & 2 \\
		\hline
		User update & Avarage & 4\\
		\hline
		Pay bill & High & 6\\
		\hline
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textit{Total} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{49}
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

- start ride -> low
- end ride? -> high
- park -> medium 
- unlock -> medium

low x 7 = 3x7 = 21
medium x 4 = 4x4 = 16
high x 2 = 6x2 = 12

tot 49 FPs per EI ti va una schweppes solo io e te?

- car search con address -> medium
- pgs search con position -> medium
- pgs search con address -> medium
- money saving option -> high
- safe area search pos -> medium
- '' add -> medium
- cars in need of maintenance -> low

lowx3 = 3x3 = 9
medium x6 = 4x6 = 24
high x1 = 6x1 = 6

39 per EQs for house music

\subsubsection{External Outputs (EOs)}

- lock car -> low
- unlock car -> low
- richiedi update dalla macchina -> medium

4x2+5x1=13 FPs per EOOOOOOOOO

\subsubsection{Overall estimation}

ILF 73
ELF 15
EI 49
EQ 39
EO 13

Total 189

con AVC 46 per Java EE
SLOC = 189 * 46 = 8694


\subsection{Cost and effort estimation: COCOMO II}


\subsubsection{Scale Drivers}

qua ci vuole la tabella dove ci sono tutti i valori

Precedentedness -> very low 6,20
flexibility -> high 2.03 o very high 1.01
risk -> very high 1,41
team -> very high 1,10
maturity -> level 3 3.12 (non so perchè)


E=B+0.01xSUM SF,whereB=0.91

E = 0.91+0.01x(6.20+1.01+1.41+1.1+3.12)-> 12,84 = 1,0384 

\subsubsection{Cost Drivers}

RELY -> nominal 1.0 (se l'applicazione non funziona perdiamo soldi e magari qualcuno ci fa causa, ma non succede il fini mondo)
DATA -> high 1.14(come l'esempio, non saprei dare altre motivazioni)
